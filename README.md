This gem provides a directory storage back-end to Persistent::Cache. Please see https://rubygems.org/gems/persistent-cache.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'persistent-cache-storage-directory'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install persistent-cache-storage-directory

## Usage

Keys are required to be strings that are valid for use as directory names. The cache then stores from a storage root (configured in the StorageDirector constructor) with a subdirectory for each key, and a file called 'cache' for the value. The first line in the cache file is the timestamp of the entry.

When a StorageDirectory is used, it can be asked whether a key is present and what the path to a cache value is using:

    get_value_path(key)

    key_cached?(key)

Tell Persistent::Cache to use this provider so:

    require 'persistent-cache/storage_directory'
    require 'persistent-cache'

    storage_location = "/tmp/directory-cache"
    freshness = nil # forever or freshness in seconds
    cache = Persistent::Cache.new(storage_location, freshness, Persistent::Cache::STORAGE_DIRECTORY)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
